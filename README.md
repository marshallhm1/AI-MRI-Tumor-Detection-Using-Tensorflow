# Tumor-Detection-Using-TensorFlow-and-Xception

This app can detect 3 types of cancer from MRI samples using TensorFlow, Xception, TKinter and OpenCV.

The .h5 file is required to compile the app but is too large for GitHub; you can download that file [here]([https://file.io/o2lDKDoY3SCC]).

I also give a live walkthrough and explanation [here]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfH0qwDjWaA&ab_channel=MarshallMorgan]).

Results of the model: 

Glioma: 84.99%

Meningioma: 98.26%

Pituitary: 90.54%

No Tumor: 97.14%
