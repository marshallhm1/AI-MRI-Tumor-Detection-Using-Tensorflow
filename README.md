This app can detect 3 types of cancer from MRI samples using TensorFlow, Xception, TKinter and OpenCV.

The .h5 file is required to compile the app but is too large for GitHub; you can download that file [here]([https://file.io/o2lDKDoY3SCC]).

The full image files are too large, but you can find both the training and testing set on [Kaggle.]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri])


I also give a live walkthrough and explanation [here]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfH0qwDjWaA&ab_channel=MarshallMorgan]).
